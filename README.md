# Code for Computer Org. & Arch Spring 2024

Stores the code that will be used in the COSC 2331 course in Spring 2024.

This repo will evolve throughout the semester as code is written during class. All code written during class will live here and be pushed at the end of each class period. Students are expected to pull from the repo between classes so they have the most up to date code.
